OPENSOFT-R is an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) that can be integrated with a DIY robotic arm to enable precise motion control. The system transmits data via a COM port to an embedded controller, including parameters such as joint angles, step counts, and other control variables derived from the robot’s kinematic and dynamic equations.

These equations can be replaced or modified to suit the specific geometric configuration of a user’s robotic arm. Once the embedded system begins receiving data through the COM port, the robot can execute motion commands in real time-completing the integration between software-based computation and hardware-level actuation.
